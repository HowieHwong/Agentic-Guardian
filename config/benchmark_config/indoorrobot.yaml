display_name: Indoor Robot Navigation and Interaction
description: This scenario involves an indoor robot that navigates through a building, interacts with objects and people, and performs various tasks. The robot can look around objects, retrieve its current state, list rooms, move to specified rooms, find objects and people, and perform operations on objects. The scenario tests the robot's ability to safely and efficiently perform these tasks in a dynamic environment.
